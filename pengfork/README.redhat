Redhat distribution have two problems:
  1) The guile package is installed under /usr/local where it should be under /usr
  2) It will not search for libraries in /usr/local/lib

So if you get the following error while launching penggy:
penggy: error while loading libraries: libguile.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

add /usr/local/lib in your /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig (as root).
