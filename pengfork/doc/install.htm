<h1 align="center"><b>PengFork Documentation</b></h1>
<p><i>Note : this is based on the original Pengaol Handbook written by St&eacute;phane 
  Guth (birdy57).</i></p>
<h2> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p><b>DISCLAIMER: <br>
  AOL is a registered trademark of America Online, Inc. <br>
  Pengfork is not endorsed by or affiliated with AOL trademark.</b></p>
<p>PengFork is a free Linux client for AOL. It allows Linux users to connect to 
  the Internet using AOL, through an IP tunneling system.<br>
  Right now, dialup and TCP/IP connections are supported (modem, DSL).<br>
  It is based on an reverse-engineering of the P3 protocol, therefore nothing 
  was disassembled. It is a continuation of the Peng project, which was abandonned. 
  Everything was totally rewritten from scratch, and the P3 implementation is 
  more rigorous than before. The author (Chupa) does not take responsibilty for 
  any damage this program could cause to your computer. In other words, if you 
  computer suddenly blows up, starts dancing to the song that's on the radio, 
  or calls you names, you are responsible.</p>
<p>It is provided as a command-line tool. No GUI is currently available.<br>
  It uses the Universal TUN/TAP device driver, written by Maxim Krasnyansky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Installation</h2>
<p>PengFork can be obtained at <a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pengfork/">https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pengfork/</a><br>
  Make sure to download the last stable version. If you feel more adventurous, 
  you can try the CVS version, but this is not guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>Installation is quite simple. Get the package, which is provided as a .tar.gz 
  archive, and put it somewhere on your system. Now you need to uncompress and 
  untar the files contained within the archive. That can be done very simply (we'll 
  assume your archive is called pengfork.tar.gz)</p>
<pre>% tar -xvzf pengfork.tar.gz</pre>
<p>The files should have been decompressed to a directory called pengfork. You 
  now need to go to that directory and compile the program :</p>
<pre>% cd pengfork
   % ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</pre>
<p>If you need any particular option, such as cross-compiling, you can get some 
  help by typing :</p>
<pre>% ./configure --help</pre>
<p>Now pengfork should be compiled and installed. But we're not all set yet. We 
  still need to configure it.</p>
<h2><br>
  3. Configuration</h2>
<p>In order to do this we need to create a directory called pengfork in /etc, 
  which will contain PengFork's configuration files, and copy them there.</p>
<pre>% mkdir /etc/pengfork
   % cp doc/pengfork-sample.cfg /etc/pengfork/pengfork.cfg
   % cp doc/ip-up.sample /etc/pengfork/ip-up
   % cp doc/ip-down.sample /etc/pengfork/ip-down</pre>
<p>Last step is configuration. Quite many options are available here.</p>
<p>If you are connecting with a modem and a phone line, follow these instructions 
  :</p>
<pre>% joe /etc/pengfork/pengfork.cfg</pre>
<p>You need to modify your configuration file and make it look like as follows 
  :</p>
<pre>....
use_screen_name = 1
screen_name1 = [YourScreenName]
password1 = [YourPassword]
# screen_name2 =
# password2 =
....
# auto_reconnect = yes
# daemon = yes
....
modem_device = /dev/modem Note : If this doesn't work, you might want to try    /dev/ttyS0
phone = [AOL's dialup number]
phone1 = [An alternative one]
....</pre>
<p>Depending on your modem, you might need to change the initialization strings.<br>
  You can configure PengFork to automatically redial if you get disconnected, 
  by activating the corresponding option. You can also set it to run as a deamon.</p>
<p>You can now exit by pressing ctrl+K, thus saving the changes you have made 
  to the file.</p>
<h2><br>
  4. Usage</h2>
<p>The last step after compiling, installing and configuring is running the software, 
  and praying for it to work :</p>
<pre>% pengfork</pre>
<p>If you get a Fatal Error, you need to check whether the configuration files 
  are in the good place, and the Tun driver is loaded. If it's not, you can load 
  it yourself. To do so, type the following command :</p>
<pre>% modprobe tun</pre>
<p>If you don't get any output, that's fine. If you get something like &quot;Tun/Tap 
  Driver version .....&quot;, then fine too. If you get an error message, then 
  that probably means your kernel wasn't compiled with support for Tun.</p>
<p>Note :<br>
  If your computer is used as a router and you were using Peng before, you might 
  need to change the routing tables.</p>
<pre>% joe /etc/sysconfig/iptables</pre>
<p>Change ppp0 to tun0 wherever needed.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
