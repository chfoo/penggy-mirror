<P>
<P> Pengaol is a Linux IP tunneling client for AOL.
<P> It support to time : modem connection (RTC/ISDN) and TCP/IP connection.
<P> Only the P3 protocol are now availlable, but i start the ELV6 kernel (Emulation from the AOL(c) 6 protocol)
<P> This sofware is based on a Reverse-ingenering from the original client, but i don´t have disassembled anything !
<P> To understand the P3 protocol, i have only sniff my modem.
<P> Because this sofware are GNU/GPL, you can sure that pengaol don´t send anything from your computer ;-),
<P> PengAol is small and fast, i don´t want to include anything. I thing , it is to the user to choose is prefered tools (AIM,Chat etc..)
<P> Have Fun, Birdy57
